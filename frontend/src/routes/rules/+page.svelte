        <strong> In the game of 8-ball pool </strong>, players aim to pocket all
        the balls in their designated group (solids or stripes) while
        strategically positioning the cue ball. The player must pocket all their
        designated balls first before attempting to sink the 8 ball to win the
        game. However, players must be careful not to pocket the 8 ball
        prematurely or commit fouls, which can result in penalties. The game
        requires a combination of skill, strategy, and careful shot selection to
        outsmart the opponent and secure victory.

        In 8-ball pool, a legal shot is one that meets certain requirements and
        does not result in a foul. The specific rules may vary depending on the
        set of rules being followed, but here are some common guidelines for a
        legal shot in 8-ball pool:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li>
            <strong>Cue Ball Contact:</strong> The cue ball must strike one of the
            balls in the player's designated group (either solids or stripes) first,
            and a ball from that group must be pocketed or hit a rail after the contact.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Object Ball Contact:</strong> After striking a ball from the
            player's designated group, the cue ball may also contact and pocket balls
            from the opposing group (opponent's balls), but it is not required.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ball Pocketed:</strong> At least one ball must be legally pocketed
            on the shot. If a player pockets a ball from their designated group,
            they continue their turn; if a ball from the opponent's group is pocketed,
            it becomes the opponent's turn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No Fouls:</strong> The shot must not result in a foul, which
            can include things like scratching (cue ball being pocketed), failing
            to hit any ball, hitting the cue ball off the table, or violating other
            specific rules.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
        It's important to note that different rule sets may have additional
        variations and requirements for a legal shot, such as whether the 8 ball
        can be pocketed early or the requirement to call shots. Therefore, it's
        always recommended to clarify and agree upon the specific rules being
        followed before playing a game of 8-ball pool.

    <p class="mb-4">
        In the game of 8-ball pool,<strong class="eightball">
            "ball in hand" refers to a situation where a player has the freedom
            to place the cue ball anywhere on the table before taking their
            shot.
        </strong>However, the specific rules regarding where the player can
        place the cue ball after a "ball in hand" situation may vary depending
        on the rule set being followed.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        In many rule sets, including popular variations of 8-ball pool such as
        BCA (Billiard Congress of America) and WPA (World Pool-Billiard
        Association) rules, when a player has "ball in hand," they can place the
        cue ball anywhere on the table, as long as it is not touching any other
        ball. There is typically no requirement for the cue ball to be played
        from a specific area such as the kitchen (also known as the "cue ball in
        the kitchen" rule).
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        <strong> The kitchen is a term </strong> used in some other cue sports games,
        such as snooker, to refer to a specific designated area of the table where
        the cue ball must be played from after certain fouls or other specific situations.
        However, in the context of 8-ball pool, the concept of the kitchen is not
        commonly used for positioning the cue ball after a "ball in hand" situation.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's always a good idea to clarify and agree upon the specific rules
        being followed with your opponent before playing a game of 8-ball pool
        to ensure a fair and enjoyable playing experience.
